# phd-thesis-template

This is a LaTeX template for Ph.D. dissertations at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University based on the [template](https://github.com/ragonneau/phd-thesis-template) created by [Tom M. Ragonneau](https://tomragonneau.com/en/), but tailored for linguistics-oriented works and multi-scripted documents. It is optimized to work with LuaLaTeX.

The repository has two branches, a `master` branch, and a `lite` branch. The `master` branch aims to showcase all the supported features (requiring a relatively lot of time and memory to compile), while the `lite` branch supplies a stripped down, fast and lightweight version of the template.
